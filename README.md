## Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop to class. I recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should purchase is 8GB of RAM. I have had one for several years, I use it almost too often, and it has never failed on me. :-)

Your MacBook must be running [OS X Yosemite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12), which is a free upgrade from the App Store. [Download and install it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12) if you haven't yet.

There is no commercial software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor and chat program.

A custom [install script](./extras/ultimate-install-script.sh) will be provided and run the first day of class.

## Prework

See [The Prework document](./prework.md).

## Final Projects

See [The Final Project document](./final-projects.md).

## After class ends

Learn server-side programming, too. Choose one:

1. Learn server-side JS (Node.js); the framework Express is built on JS
- Learn PHP; the framework Symfony is built on PHP; Wordpress is also built on PHP
- Learn Python; the framework Django is built on Python
- Learn Ruby; the framework Rails is built on Ruby
- Learn C# (pronounced "C-sharp"); the framework ASP.NET MVC 4.5 is built on C#

## Policies

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**
