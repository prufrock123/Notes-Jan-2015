# Final Projects

> Also called the *Capstone Projects*

This is going to be a large project that you will carry out **BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT** to show off on Demo Day (Friday, December 12th).

## Requirements:

- You must either do the project **BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT**. If you partner with a Rails student.
- You must make regular commits each day (atleast 30 commits throughout the 3 week period).
- You must have tests written for your project.
- You must use a script loader (like `loader.js` and `require.js`), or `browserify`.
- You must have `"use strict";` in your code.
- You must write SOLID code.
- You must handle throwing Errors (`throw new Error("some error message")`).
- You must use lodash templates or React components.
- You must use use atleast 2 different service APIs (see the [API doc for resources](./APIs.md)).
- Additionally, your app must save data, not just pull it down.
- You must use atleast 2 different Browser APIs (again, see the [API doc for resources](./APIs.md)).
- You must either include polyfills for older browsers, or gracefully show error messages for browsers that don't support something (http://caniuse.com can tell you what is supported).
- Your UI must be **responsive** and work on both desktop and mobile
- Your Project proposal to your instructor must start with an elevator pitch:
    - 15 to 25 words of what your app does
- You must run SCRUM processes on a Trello board. Additionally, you must document atleast 8 User Stories about your app.
    
    > "As an admin user, I want the ability to create courses so that learners can see what courses are available."
     
    User stories follow this structure: "As a ________ I want _______ so that ________"

- You must research your APIs to ensure it is CORS or JSONP supported. If it isn't, you'll need a server-side proxy. If a server-side proxy might be needed, **you need to verify this immediately and let Matt know**.
- You must write a README that lists all the technologies and APIs used in the project.

## Pitching The Projects

Start thinking about final projects a week ahead of time, and meet with your instructor if you're devoid of ideas. 

Make your projects are centered around things you truly care about; bee-keeping, beer, dancing, hiking, basketball, etc. This makes a huge difference and can make the project a lot of fun.

## Ask your peers for feedback

Community feedback is invaluable in keeping scope-creep out and making sure the projects are the right mix of ambition, talent, feasibility, and hubris (a careful mixture of all four is required, IMHO).

Peer code reviews are also extremely helpful.

## SCRUM

- Before Sprints:
    + Define User Personas
    + Write User Stories
    + Play "Planning Poker"
    + Prioritize feature sets
    + Estimate time for tasks
    + Wireframe the UI, plan the RESTful API and resources (i.e. Domain Models) you will need to model a system
- During Sprints:
    - Each morning, there is a standup which involves
        + A brief overview of the project and its status
        + Each team member will discuss:        
            * I did yesterday
            * I'm doing today
            * and any blockers / hurdles I'm facing
- After Sprints:
    + Code reviews
    + Beer / Coffee

## Final Project Q&A

1. Where do we have to be during final projects? In the lab? Home?

    Monday through Thursday, be at The Iron Yard's office in the morning. We will be holding some small lectures here and there, and I will be helping to answer questions. **If you don't show up, ask questions, and drive your project in this crucial 3-week period, you won't receive career support.**

    Fridays you will be free to work from home. (But we'll still have `#IronPintsâ„¢`)

- How often will lectures happen, and will they be optional?

    They will happen probably two to three times each week; in the mornings. Some lectures will be optional, some will not. I will let you know in Slack ahead of time.

- How long will lectures be?

    They will be kept to a maximum of 1.5 or 2 hours.

- What content will be covered?

    TBD.

- How often do we checkin with the instructor? What about the campus director?

    You must checkin with your instructor each morning with a standup. Once or twice each week, you should also be checking in with the campus director to discuss career support. 

- How much job-related stuff should I be doing?

    This is a case-by-case basis, but The Iron Yard staff will be sharing job-related resources to help kickstart the job search process. Best rule of thumb:

        - During final projects, do only two 1-hr job searches each week. That means, pick two evenings (Tues, Thurs), schedule them on your calendar (to get alerts so you don't forget), and don't do anything more.
        - After final projects, you will want to apply to 3 jobs each day (average: 15 a week).

    **I (Matt) already have some cool job sites and search engines for you, [collected here (link)](./extras/job-resources.md). You're welcome :-)**

- What happens if I don't finish my project?

    You don't present at Demo Day; and you'll have to complete it after class ends.

- If I don't finish, will I receive career support?

    Not until you finish the project (you get to do that after class) and show you worked hard. The real hustle begins after class, when you start the job hunt. I'll teach you to fish, but I won't fish for you. :-)
