# Prework

Here is some prework to prepare for The Iron Yard's Front End Course!

Prework is material to help you get on the same page as others. Do the best you can, and let Matt know how it's going! :-)

What is prework?

- a series of base information designed to bring you up to speed as much as possible before the class. We have some online coursework, tools, and advanced materials for those of you who want to go further.
- starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.
- Prework only covers the basics of a language; What we teach goes much deeper than tutorials can cover.

**Part 0**

Check the software and accounts you will need in the [Materials sections](#materials). Signup for any accounts that you currently do no have.

If you're new to a Mac (or old, even), check out https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/.

**Part 1**

Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

Compose an email to Matt answering the following questions:

- Which type of mindset (growth or fixed) do you think you are most strongly associated with? Why?
- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

Start a blog on http://medium.com, if you don't already have one, and read the post, slides, and watch the video series on personal branding with The Iron Yard's John Saddington:

**Part 2**

Start these and finish (as much as humanly possible):

1. Learn to use the terminal (estimated time, 4 hours)

    The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

    Especially if you’ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

    Read the following article and complete the course on Treehouse:

2. Learn some basic HTML and CSS

3. Start learning JavaScript

4. Start learning Git

Spend ~ 1-2 hours each day on the courses to round out any foundational knowledge necessary to start Matt's class.

**Part 3**

If you are ready for more advanced stuff, whet your whistle with this bonus material:

- watch these podcasts (there are new releases approx. every week): http://www.atozcss.com/
- start the Codecademy jQuery course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
- Rocked the other stuff and still hungry for more? Have a read through of Douglas Crockford’s “JavaScript: The Good Parts”: http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/
