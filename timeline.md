### Week 10, 11, 12
The last three weeks are for final projects. Each student will design, build and deploy a major project of their own, using as much tech from the previous nine weeks as possible. Lecture is light and mostly Q&A based on problems students encounter. The rest of the time is spent working on final projects and prepping demos
